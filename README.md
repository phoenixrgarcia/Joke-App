#Personal Notes:
I was excited to get hands on experience with ASP.NET Core to develop this web application. Even though it is a simple application
I've learned a lot about the Model-View-Controller framework and how to work with dotnet commands. I used VS Code to work on this 
application, which means I gained valuable experience interacting with code through a terminal.
